# Codesquad Comics Server

 
## About The Project


<!-- Insert a project screenshot here -->

This project has the front-end code for the project. The goal of the project is to implement a CRUD app  where the  user can create/add a new comic to the collection, read and view the details of the comic, update the comic information and delete. This project was part of the coursework and is still a work in progress. 

The client side is deployed with Netlify and the server side with Render. 

### Future Tasks 
 - adjusting the sizing
 - tweaking the route mappings so the landing page is  the home page
 - surfacing all the comics
 - testing outside users adding comics
